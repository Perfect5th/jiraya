# jiraya — agent-powered Jira triage

An automated triage system that polls Jira for new / untriaged tickets,
classifies their intent with an LLM agent, hands them off to specialized worker
agents, and either transitions them to **In Progress** or surfaces them to a
**TUI dashboard** for human review.

This repository contains the **triage agent harness** and the **TUI dashboard**.

## Architecture

jiraya uses a **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** architecture so the business
logic is fully decoupled from Jira, the LLM, and the front-end:

                              driven adapters
```

- **`domain/`** — pure entities (`Ticket`, `Classification`, `RepoResolution`,
  `WorkResult`, `InboxEntry`, `TriageMetrics`, …) and domain events. No external
  dependencies.
- **`ports/`** — inbound (`TriageService`) and outbound (`TicketSource`,
  `Classifier`, `RepoResolver`, `LearnedRulesStore`, `WorkspaceProvisioner`,
  `WorkAgentRunner`, `WorkerAgent`, `InboxRepository`, `EventBus`) protocols.
- **`application/`** — the harness: `TriageService` (classify → resolve repo →
  route → validate → transition → provision → run work), `AgentRouter`,
  `TriagePoller`.
- **`adapters/`** — `inmemory` (default, offline), `jira` (real REST API),
  `classifier` (keyword + Copilot CLI), `resolver` (registry + learned + keyword),
  `workspace` (noop + git), `work_runner` (noop + Copilot), `agents`.
- **`tui/`** — the Textual dashboard (a driving adapter).
- **`composition.py`** — the composition root that wires everything together.

## Workflow

1. **Poll** — `TriagePoller` fetches `Untriaged` / `To Do` tickets on an interval.
2. **Classify** — the `Classifier` agent labels each ticket (Bug / Feature
   Request / Documentation / Unknown) with a confidence score.
3. **Resolve repo** — the `RepoResolver` maps the ticket to a repository
   (`clone_url` + path) with a confidence score. Low confidence is escalated
   through the inbox so a human can supply the repo (which also *teaches* the
   resolver).
4. **Route & validate** — `AgentRouter` hands the ticket (and its resolved repo)
   to the matching worker agent, which performs initial validation (is the bug
   reproducible? is the feature a duplicate?).
5. **Transition & start work** — actionable tickets are moved to **In Progress**,
   a workspace is provisioned (`git clone`), and a **work agent** runs in it
   (e.g. the Copilot CLI implements the change and opens a pull request);
   low-confidence or ambiguous tickets are surfaced to the dashboard inbox.

## Repository resolution

After classification the harness resolves **which repo** a ticket belongs to,
mirroring how the classifier is structured: a `RepoResolver` port with layered
adapters and a confidence gate.

- **Registry** (`RegistryRepoResolver`) — an authoritative project→repo mapping
  loaded from a YAML catalog (`--repo-registry`, see
  [`examples/repo_registry.yaml`](examples/repo_registry.yaml)). **Seed it from
  Jira dev-status / commit-mining**: the issue→commit→repo links Jira already
  records give you an empirical mapping (and an eval set) on day one.
- **Learned rules** (`LearnedRulesRepoResolver`) — mappings taught by inbox
  corrections; persisted with `--learned-rules <path>`. Each correction improves
  precision over time.
- **Keyword / code-tokens** (`KeywordRepoResolver`) — a deterministic matcher for
  the residual (module names, path-like tokens, repo-name fragments). This is the
  seam where code-search + an LLM would layer in next.

These are combined by a `CompositeRepoResolver` (learned → registry → tokens);
the first *confident* hit wins. If none is confident the ticket is escalated at
the **repository** stage. In the dashboard, press `d` and paste a **clone URL**:
that unblocks the ticket *and* teaches the resolver, so future tickets in the
same project resolve automatically.

When a ticket transitions, a `WorkspaceProvisioner` hands the worker agent a
local checkout. The default is a no-op that only reports the intended path;
`--provision` performs a real `git clone` (never in dry-run). Provisioning
happens **before** the status change, so a **failed `git clone` is surfaced to
the inbox** (stage `provisioning`) with the exact command and error captured —
respond with a corrected repo **clone URL** to teach the resolver and re-run.

## Work agent (implement + open a PR)

Right after provisioning, the harness calls a `WorkAgentRunner` to actually do
the work in the cloned workspace. The `CopilotWorkAgentRunner` invokes the
GitHub Copilot CLI in the checkout to implement the ticket, push a branch, and
open a pull request; the resulting PR URL is recorded on the outcome and shown
in the dashboard.

```bash
# Resolve repo, clone it, run Copilot, and open a PR (real writes — use --apply)
uv run jiraya run --once --apply \
  --repo-registry examples/repo_registry.yaml \
  --work
```

`--work` implies `--provision` (the agent needs a checkout) and, like all
writes, is **disabled in dry-run**. The default runner is a no-op, so the work
agent never runs unless you opt in. The port is the seam for other runners
(a different CLI agent, a queue worker, etc.).

### Model selection

The classifier model and the work model are configured **separately**:

- `--classifier-model` — the model the Copilot CLI *classifier* uses.
- `--work-model` — the model the *work agent* uses. If unset, each ticket uses
  the model **recommended by its classification** (`Classification.recommended_model`).

The classifier recommends a model per ticket — a deeper model for complex/risky
work (e.g. a bug with a stack trace or race condition), a cheaper one for
trivial changes (e.g. a docs typo). The keyword classifier uses a tiered
heuristic; the Copilot classifier asks the LLM and falls back to that heuristic.
An explicit `--work-model` always overrides the recommendation.

```bash
# Cheap classifier, per-ticket recommended work model
uv run jiraya run --once --apply --classifier copilot \
  --classifier-model gpt-5-mini --work

# Pin both explicitly
uv run jiraya run --once --apply --classifier copilot \
  --classifier-model gpt-5-mini --work --work-model claude-sonnet-4.5
```

```bash
# Resolve against your registry, persist what you teach, and clone workspaces
uv run jiraya run --once --apply \
  --repo-registry examples/repo_registry.yaml \
  --learned-rules ~/.config/jiraya/learned-rules.yaml \
  --provision

# Don't escalate on unresolved repos (skip the repo confidence gate)
uv run jiraya run --once --no-require-repo
```

## Install

Requires [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
```

## Run

Launch the real-time dashboard (default command):

```bash
uv run jiraya            # or: uv run jiraya tui
```

Dashboard keys: `p` poll now · `g` inject a demo ticket · `d` open the
detail/respond view for the selected inbox item · `r` resolve it · `q` quit.

### Inbox detail & responding

Select an inbox exception and press `d` to open an expandable detail view that
shows the full picture the harness captured: the worker **agent**, the
classifier's **rationale**, the specific **validation details** (e.g. "no
reproduction steps"), category and confidence. From there you can **respond**
with a note that either:

- **posts a comment** back to the Jira issue (e.g. asking the reporter for
  reproduction steps), and/or
- **re-runs triage** using your note as an authoritative hint — so telling it
  "this is actually a bug" re-classifies and routes the ticket accordingly.

Re-running resolves the original inbox item (a fresh one is raised only if the
ticket still can't be actioned). In dry-run mode comments are **not** posted and
re-triage performs no writes.

> The interactive TUI needs a real terminal. In CI / headless contexts use
> `jiraya run` (below) or drive the app via Textual's `run_test()` pilot.

Run the harness headlessly:

```bash
uv run jiraya run --once          # one poll cycle, print a summary
uv run jiraya run --cycles 3      # three cycles then exit
uv run jiraya run                 # poll forever (Ctrl-C to stop)
```

### Classifier selection

```bash
# Use the GitHub Copilot CLI as the classification agent
uv run jiraya run --once --classifier copilot

# Fall back to the deterministic keyword classifier if Copilot is unavailable
uv run jiraya run --once --classifier copilot --copilot-fallback
```

By default jiraya runs fully offline against an in-memory Jira seeded with a
representative batch of tickets, so it is runnable with zero configuration.

## Connecting to real Jira

jiraya authenticates to **Jira Cloud** with your email + an API token
([create one here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens))
using HTTP Basic auth, and reads issues with the current
`/rest/api/3/search/jql` endpoint (token pagination).

Provide credentials via environment variables or a `.jira.env` file in the
working directory (auto-loaded; **git-ignored** — never commit it):

```bash
# .jira.env
JIRA_BASE=https://your-org.atlassian.net   # JIRA_BASE_URL also accepted
JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_JQL=assignee = currentUser() AND status in ("To Do", "Untriaged") ORDER BY created ASC
```

When credentials are present, `--source auto` (the default) selects real Jira;
otherwise it falls back to the in-memory demo. The chosen mode is always printed
at startup — jiraya never silently degrades.

### Dry-run vs. apply (write safety)

Triage **mutates the board** (it transitions actionable tickets to *In
Progress*). To avoid surprises, a real Jira source is **read-only by default**:
every intended transition is logged but not written. Pass `--apply` to actually
perform transitions.

```bash
# Preview triage of your real tickets — no writes (default for real Jira)
uv run jiraya run --once

# Actually transition actionable tickets to In Progress
uv run jiraya run --once --apply

# Live dashboard over real Jira, read-only
uv run jiraya tui --classifier copilot
```

Escalations are surfaced to the dashboard inbox **without** changing the
ticket's Jira status (the harness only ever writes the *In Progress*
transition, and only with `--apply`). The native Jira **issue type** (Bug,
Story, Epic, …) is used as a strong classification signal.

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The suite covers the domain, the harness, every adapter (including the Jira
REST adapter via `httpx.MockTransport`, token pagination, the read-only
dry-run wrapper, and the Copilot classifier via an injected runner), and the
TUI via Textual's headless pilot.
