"""jiraya — agent-powered Jira triage agent with a TUI dashboard.

Implemented with a hexagonal architecture:

    domain/        pure business model (entities + events)
    ports/         abstract boundaries (inbound + outbound protocols)
    application/   the triage harness (service, router, poller)
    adapters/      concrete implementations (in-memory, jira, classifier, agents)
    tui/           Textual dashboard (a driving adapter)
    composition.py the composition root that wires it all together
