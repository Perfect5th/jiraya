"""The polling service — jiraya's scheduled background heartbeat.

Periodically asks the ticket source for fresh work and runs every ticket
through the triage harness. Blocking work (Jira HTTP calls, Copilot CLI
subprocesses) is pushed onto worker threads so an event loop driving a TUI is
never starved.
