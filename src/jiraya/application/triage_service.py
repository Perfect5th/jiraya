r"""The triage harness — orchestration of the end-to-end workflow.

This is the application core that ties the ports together:

    classify -> resolve repo -> route -> validate -> transition  (happy path)
                                                  \-> escalate    (low confidence)

It depends only on ports, never on concrete adapters, so the same logic runs
against the in-memory fakes, a real Jira instance, or the Copilot CLI.
